# Roamcast Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Roamcast application, covering end-to-end testing, integration testing, and unit testing approaches.

## Testing Layers

### 1. End-to-End Testing
Tests that verify complete user flows and business scenarios.

#### Key Flows to Test
1. **User Authentication**
   - Complete signup flow
   - Login flow
   - Password reset flow
   - Session management and persistence
   - Logout flow

2. **Guide Experience**
   - Tour creation and setup
   - Tour management (edit, delete, schedule)
   - Starting and ending live tours
   - Audio broadcasting during tours
   - Participant management
   - Receiving and managing tips

3. **Tourist Experience**
   - Tour discovery and joining
   - Audio reception and quality
   - Location tracking and map interaction
   - Tipping flow
   - Rating and feedback submission

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Stripe integration for tips
   - Payment success flows
   - Payment failure handling
   - Transaction history

5. **Real-time Features**
   - LiveKit audio streaming
   - Location updates
   - Chat functionality
   - Participant status updates

### 2. Integration Testing
Tests that verify the interaction between different components and services.

#### Key Areas
1. **External Service Integration**
   - Supabase authentication
   - Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Stripe payment processing
   - LiveKit audio streaming

2. **Data Flow Testing**
   - Database operations
   - State management
   - Cache management
   - API interactions

3. **Cross-component Communication**
   - Context providers
   - Event handling
   - Navigation flows
   - Data sharing between components

### 3. Unit Testing
Tests that verify individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Key Components
1. **UI Components**
   - Individual screen components
   - Reusable UI components
   - Form validation
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

2. **Business Logic**
   - Utility functions
   - Data transformations
   - Calculations (e.g., payment amounts, distances)
   - State management logic

3. **Services**
   - API service methods
   - Authentication service
   - Payment service
   - Location service
   - Audio service

## Testing Tools and Setup

### Tools
1. **Jest**: Primary testing framework
2. **React Native Testing Library**: Component testing
3. **Mock Service Worker**: API mocking
4. **Jest Native**: Native component testing
5. **Detox**: End-to-end testing (optional)

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Mocks**
   - External API responses
   - Native module functionality
   - Geolocation services
   - Audio services
   - Payment processing

2. **Test Data**
   - User profiles
   - Tour data
   - Payment information
   - Location data

## Testing Priorities

### High Priority
1. Authentication flows
2. Payment processing
3. Audio streaming functionality
4. Core tour management features
5. Critical user flows

### Medium Priority
1. Error handling
2. Edge cases
3. Performance testing
4. UI/UX testing
5. Cross-device compatibility

### Low Priority
1. Non-critical features
2. Administrative functions
3. Analytics
4. Optional features

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up testing environment
2. Implement basic unit tests
3. Create test utilities and helpers
4. Establish CI/CD integration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement authentication tests
2. Add payment processing tests
3. Create audio streaming tests
4. Add tour management tests

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Implement service integration tests
2. Add cross-component tests
3. Create end-to-end tests for critical flows

### Phase 4: Enhancement
1. Add edge case testing
2. Implement performance tests
3. Add accessibility tests
4. Create stress tests for real-time features

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

2. **Code Coverage**
   - Aim for 80% coverage for critical paths
   - Focus on business logic coverage
   - Include edge cases

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular updates to test suites
   - Removal of obsolete tests
   - Documentation updates

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize test execution time
   - Parallel test execution where possible
   - Efficient test data management

## Continuous Integration

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Maintain test environment stability
   - Regular test maintenance

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Minimum code coverage requirements
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Code quality metrics

## Reporting and Monitoring

1. **Test Reports**
   - Coverage reports
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

2. **Monitoring**
   - Test execution times
   - Failure patterns
   - Coverage trends

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
2. Set up initial test infrastructure
3. Create first set of critical tests
4. Establish regular testing cadence
