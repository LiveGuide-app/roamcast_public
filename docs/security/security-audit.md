# Security Audit Report - Pre-Beta Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the security findings and recommendations for the Roamcast application before going into beta testing. The audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Environment Variables and API Keys
**Severity: High**
- API keys and sensitive credentials are exposed in `eas.json` and configuration files
- Sensitive credentials are visible in version control

**Exposed Credentials Details:**

1. **Critical Credentials (Exposed in eas.json):**
   - **Supabase Anon Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imp3dm5saHBubm12Z3F6dnplb2N6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDI1NzEzNTIsImV4cCI6MjA1ODE0NzM1Mn0.yCErsYwA-gnLkS3gI_a9yQVmZtT5jl-sYmOFG_l2_oM`
   - **Supabase URL**: `https://jwvnlhpnnmvgqzvzeocz.supabase.co`
   - **Stripe Publishable Key**: `pk_test_51R7dsS2XCNsYZxfb1hJjiEjZZOs67vBVTEZf6VyWKNtG20Yih47P3Eo7PsFIu12Kiaq8YilGKWHMMfOGBNoPhJLg008gilzMkA`
   - **LiveKit WebSocket URL**: `wss://livekit.beatbrief.ai:443`

2. **Critical Credentials (Referenced in Documentation):**
   - **Stripe Secret Key**: Referenced in multiple files but appears to be properly stored in environment variables
   - **Stripe Webhook Secret**: Referenced in multiple files but appears to be properly stored in environment variables
   - **LiveKit API Key and Secret**: Referenced in multiple files but appears to be properly stored in environment variables
   - **Supabase Service Role Key**: Referenced in multiple files but appears to be properly stored in environment variables

**How Credentials Are Exposed:**
1. **Direct Hardcoding**: The `eas.json` file contains hardcoded API keys and URLs for all build environments (development, preview, and production)
2. **Documentation References**: Some documentation files contain examples of environment variables with placeholder values, but these are not actual credentials
3. **Code References**: Many files reference environment variables, but most appear to be properly using environment variables rather than hardcoding values

**Recommendations:**
- Remove all API keys and sensitive credentials from version control
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper secret management for production deployment
- Consider using a secrets management service for production
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Move all credentials from `eas.json` to environment variables or a secure secrets management system
- Review all documentation to ensure no actual credentials are included, even in examples

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
**Severity: High**
- Basic authentication implementation present but could be strengthened
- Limited protection against brute force attacks

**Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) for guide accounts
- Implement session timeout and automatic logout
- Add device fingerprinting for suspicious activity detection
- Implement proper password complexity requirements
- Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### 3. API Security
**Severity: High**
- Some API endpoints may be vulnerable to common attacks
- Limited input validation on some endpoints

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper CORS policies - Don't need it as it is a REact Native App
- Add request validation and sanitization
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add request signing for sensitive operations
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Add API versioning
- Implement proper API documentation

## Important Findings

### 4. Data Protection
**Severity: Medium**
- Sensitive data handling could be improved
- Limited encryption for some data types

**Recommendations:**
- Implement data encryption at rest
- Add proper data masking for sensitive information
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Add data classification system

### 5. Payment Security
**Severity: High**
- Payment processing security could be enhanced
- Limited validation for some payment operations

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper PCI compliance measures
- Add additional validation for payment amounts
- Implement proper error handling for failed payments
- Add transaction monitoring for suspicious activity
- Implement proper refund handling
- Add payment dispute resolution process

### 6. WebSocket Security
**Severity: Medium**
- LiveKit WebSocket connections could be more secure
- Limited connection validation

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper WebSocket authentication
- Add connection encryption
- Implement proper connection validation
- Add rate limiting for WebSocket connections
- Implement proper error handling for connection failures
- Add connection monitoring

## Additional Recommendations

### 7. Input Validation
**Severity: Medium**
- Some input validation could be strengthened
- Limited sanitization for some inputs

**Recommendations:**
- Implement stricter input validation
- Add proper sanitization for user inputs
- Implement proper error messages
- Add validation for file uploads
- Implement proper handling of special characters
- Add input length restrictions

### 8. Error Handling
**Severity: Medium**
- Error handling could expose sensitive information
- Limited error logging

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper error logging
- Add error monitoring
- Implement proper error messages for users
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms
- Implement proper error reporting
- Add error tracking system

### 9. Session Management
**Severity: Medium**
- Session management could be improved
- Limited session controls

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper session timeout
- Add session invalidation on logout
- Implement proper session storage
- Add session monitoring
- Implement proper session recovery
- Add concurrent session handling

### 10. Code Security
**Severity: Medium**
- Some code patterns could be more secure
- Limited code protection

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper code signing
- Add code obfuscation for sensitive parts
- Implement proper dependency management
- Add security scanning in CI/CD
- Implement proper code review process
- Add automated security testing

## Action Items Priority

### Immediate (Before Beta)
1. Remove exposed API keys and credentials
2. Implement rate limiting for authentication
3. Strengthen API security measures
4. Enhance payment security
5. Implement proper error handling

### Short-term (During Beta)
1. Add MFA for guide accounts
2. Implement data encryption
3. Enhance WebSocket security
4. Improve input validation
5. Add session management improvements

### Long-term (Post-Beta)
1. Implement advanced monitoring
2. Add advanced security features
3. Enhance infrastructure security
4. Implement advanced app security
5. Add comprehensive security testing

## Conclusion
While the application has a good foundation for security, there are several areas that need improvement before going into beta testing. The most critical issues are related to exposed credentials, authentication security, and API security. Addressing these issues should be prioritized before the beta release.

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize the recommendations
2. Create a security improvement plan
3. Implement the immediate action items
4. Schedule regular security audits
5. Establish security monitoring and alerting
6. Create security documentation and guidelines

## Notes
- This audit is not exhaustive and should be supplemented with regular security testing
- New security measures should be tested thoroughly before implementation
- Security should be an ongoing process, not a one-time fix
- Regular security training for the development team is recommended
